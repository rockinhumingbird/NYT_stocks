### Data
- There are two sources of data provided in this dataset:

1. News Headline data: I called New York Times archive news API.

## Procedure
- Headlines Filtering:
  Sections included: 'Business', 'National', 'World', 'U.S.' , 'Politics', 'Opinion', 'Tech', 'Science',  'Health' and 'Foreignâ€˜.

- Merge stock indices price with headlines each day

- Storing (pickling) the data

- Feature engineering

- Modeling


### Task
Predicting stock price, adding text features using NLP techniques.

Approach
Combinations of a variety of strategies:
- Sentiment analysis using Textblob, get the polarity score and subjectvitity score
- Using technical indicators as external financial predictors
  1. Calculate open - close/open percentage
